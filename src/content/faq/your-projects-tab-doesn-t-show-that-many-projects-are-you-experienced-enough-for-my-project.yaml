  Your Projects tab doesn't show that many projects. Are you experienced enough

answer: >-
  Most 3D modeling jobs and animation productions (where we aren't the lead
  animation studio) are delivered under a "ghost license". We give away the full
  copyrights, and therefore the rights to publicly use the content or project
  name for our own promotion.
