question: >-
  I would like to hire Hoef Entertainment for a 3D modeling job. Why isn't there
  an option to request a 3D model portfolio?
answer: >-
  When we sell our 3D models, we usually sell the full copyrights with it.
  Therefore, we lose the ability to use the models for our own promotion (unless
  agreed on by contract). For that reason, the number of models we can show
  potential clients is limited.
