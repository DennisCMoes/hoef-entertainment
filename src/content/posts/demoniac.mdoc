Demoniac, directed by Will Evans, is set 5 years after the End of Year Bonfire Party, where Steve Briggs (played by Jak Evans), tries to unleash his newly found superpower on his high school bullies. He starts running from the police as he tries to live a quiet life and find the origin of his powers.
