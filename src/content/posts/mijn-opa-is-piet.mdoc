*Mijn Opa is Piet* is a 2024 Dutch short film created by Het Sint-Ensemble—a collective of aspiring film and theater makers, dedicated to producing inclusive Sinterklaas-themed content. The film was directed by Stein Verwij, he collaborated with producers Bonnie Verhoeven and  Loek de Jongh to bring this project to life. The role of grandpa Piet is portrayed by Anton Aarts.
Set in early December, the story follows Pip, a young girl who enjoys visiting her grandfather, Opa Piet, during the dark, chilly evenings leading up to Sinterklaas. Grandpa Piet tells Pip stories about being Sinterklaas' first ever Piet. Pip's disbelief and curiosity send her on an old-fashioned “gezelig” adventure.
