      "I would like to hire Hoef Entertainment for a 3D modeling job. Why isn't there an option to request a 3D model portfolio?",
    answer:
      'When we sell our 3D models, we usually sell the full copyrights with it. Therefore, we lose the ability to use the models for our own promotion (unless agreed on by contract). For that reason, the number of models we can show potential clients is limited.',

      "Your Projects tab doesn't show that many projects. Are you experienced enough for my project?",
    answer:
      'Most 3D modeling jobs and animation productions (where we aren\'t the lead animation studio) are delivered under a "ghost license". We give away the full copyrights, and therefore the rights to publicly use the content or project name for our own promotion.',

      'We have quite some experience producing animated short films (check out our past productions). Our studio has experienced in-house modelers, animators, and storyboard artists. For screenwriting, casting, and sound design, we work with a trusted group of freelancers. If you have a proper movie pitch, we would love to make an appointment with you! Please send us a message through the contact form.',
